# Intro
`sane-dbc` addresses the aspect of RDBMS interaction in the Java programming language.

While numerous libraries exist in the JVM ecosystem which cope with this in an elegant, well-grounded and efficient manner,
to our knowledge the **Java** alternatives currently widespread fall short in one way or another.

`sane-dbc` provides an effective, performant and robust way to interact with RDBMS in Java. It is based on SQL and the
[DB Monad](https://github.com/functionaljava/functionaljava/blob/master/core/src/main/java/fj/control/db/DB.java).

That is, you use
* SQL and your RDBMS system's specific facilities to interact with it in the way best suited to your application
* the DB class to compose operations into larger operations and programs, and to separate DB operations' **description** from
their execution (**interpretation**), which leads to large increase in programmer efficiency and code correctness
* the facilities provided by `sane-dbc` to achieve common programming tasks, as well as spare yourself from boilerplate, such as the one
inherent in JDBC

# Quickstart

`sane-dbc` is hosted on [Artifactory OSS](https://oss.jfrog.org/artifactory/libs-snapshot/) repository.

With `gradle`, you can refer to `sane-dbc` snapshot version in the following way:

```groovy
repositories {
    maven {
        url 'https://oss.jfrog.org/artifactory/libs-snapshot/'
    }
}

dependencies {

    // the sane-dbc library
    compile('com.novarto:sane-dbc-core:0.9.1-SNAPSHOT') {
        changing = true
    }
    
    
    // HikariCP support
    compile('com.novarto:sane-dbc-hikari:0.9.1-SNAPSHOT') {
        changing = true
    }
    
    // The core library provides support for asynchronous interpretation through AsyncDbInterpeter, which returns CompletableFuture
    // If in addition you require support for Guava ListenableFuture, use this jar:
    compile('com.novarto:sane-dbc-guava:0.9.1-SNAPSHOT') {
        changing = true
    }
}
```
You can refer to `sane-dbc` in Maven and other tools equivalently.


# Tutorial

## Concepts

### The essence of a JDBC interaction

Let's start with a small example. We need a table to work with:
```hsqldb
CREATE TABLE FOO (ID INTEGER IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY, DESCRIPTION NVARCHAR(100))
```
Let's look at some plain old pieces of code which read or mutate it:

```java
    void insertSomeFoos(Connection c) throws SQLException
    {
        try(PreparedStatement insert = c.prepareStatement(
                "INSERT INTO FOO(DESCRIPTION) VALUES (?)"
        ))
        {
            for(String descr: asList("one", "two", "three"))
            {
                insert.setString(1, descr);
                insert.executeUpdate();
            }

        }
    }
```

```java
    List<Foo> selectTheFoos(Connection c) throws SQLException
    {
        try(PreparedStatement s = c.prepareStatement("SELECT ID, DESCRIPTION FROM FOO"))
        {
            List<Foo> result = new ArrayList<>();
            ResultSet rs = s.executeQuery();
            while(rs.next())
            {
                result.add(new Foo(rs.getInt(1), rs.getString(2)));
            }

            return result;

        }
    }
```

An RDBMS interaction in Java, then, takes the form
```java
A run(Connection c) throws SQLException;
```
, where `A` is a type parameter.
This is exactly the `run` method of the [DB class](https://github.com/functionaljava/functionaljava/blob/master/core/src/main/java/fj/control/db/DB.java).
We'll be using that from now on.

*For operations returning nothing (DB mutations, where we are only interested in changing the tables state), in Java it is
customary to use `void`, as above. However, we want to parametrize on the return type, and `java.lang.Void` is strange in that its
only 'valid' value is `null`, which can lead to NPE. We will instead use another type with only one value which is null-safe -
[Unit](https://github.com/functionaljava/functionaljava/blob/master/core/src/main/java/fj/Unit.java). You obtain a Unit value
to return by calling `Unit.unit()`.*

### Description
>A `DB` instance is just a **description** of a database interaction.

If we just construct a `DB`, nothing will happen - there will
be no connections, calling the database, or any other *side effects*. In other words, a method returning a `DB` is
**[referentially transparent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency)** 

(*all the example code in this tutorial is published in our [repo](sane-dbc-examples/src/test/java/com/novarto/sanedbc/examples)*)

 ```java
    @Test
    public void nothingHappens()
    {
        @SuppressWarnings("unused")
        SelectOp.FjList<String> selectThem = new SelectOp.FjList<>(
                "SELECT FOO FROM WHATEVER",
                NO_BINDER,
                rs -> rs.getString(1)
        );
    }
```

### Interpreter
In the above example nothing happens, and rightly so. Nobody called the `run()` method on our `DB` (in this case, `SelectOp`).

>A piece of code which takes a `DB<A>`, runs it, and returns some other value, is called an **interpreter**

Since running a `DB` requires a `Connection`, the interpreter also needs to know how to spawn connections.

The simplest interpreter we can imagine is one that calls run() in the caller thread, and upon success returns the `DB` result.
Upon error it throws.

We have such an interpreter baked into `sane-dbc-core`, we just need to supply it with the code which spawns connections,
and give it a spin:


```java

            @Test
            public void syncInterpreter()
            {
                // create a synchronous DB interpreter. It is a stateless object, and the act of creating one is also
                // referentially transparent
                SyncDbInterpreter dbi = new SyncDbInterpreter(
                        // provide a piece of code which knows how to spawn connections
                        // in this case we are just using the DriverManager
                        () -> DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:hsqldb:mem:DescribeVsInterpret", "sa", "")
                );
        
                // submit an Update (mutate) operation which creates a table
                dbi.submit(new UpdateOp(
                        "CREATE TABLE FOO (WHATEVER VARCHAR(200))",
                        NO_BINDER
                ));
        
                // objects we will insert in the table
                List<String> helloSaneDbc = List.arrayList("hello", "sane", "dbc");
        
                //insert some data
                Option<Integer> updateCount = dbi.submit(
                        //this describes an operation which inserts an iterable of objects in a table via addBatch / executeBatch
                        new BatchUpdateOp<>(
                                "INSERT INTO FOO(WHATEVER) VALUES(?)",
                                x -> preparedStatement -> preparedStatement.setString(1, x),
                                helloSaneDbc
                        )
                );
        
                // the operation returns an optional update count, since the JDBC driver might not return an update count at all
                assertThat(updateCount, is(some(3)));
        
                
                List<String> result = dbi.submit(
                        // select all of the objects in the table
                        new SelectOp.FjList<>("SELECT WHATEVER FROM FOO", NO_BINDER, resultSet -> resultSet.getString(1))
                );
        
                
                assertThat(result, is(helloSaneDbc));
            }

``` 

*By interpreting the `DB` result in our code using a `SyncDbInterpeter`, we explicitly state we do not not care about error handling, or about the caller thread getting blocked waiting on JDBC. This is mostly useful (and convenient) in unit testing your app's `DB` layer. Later we will learn about interpreters more suitable for production code.*

### Summary

`sane-dbc` works with only two abstractions

* A `DB` is a description of operations which will be executed against a database
* An interpreter is responsible for executing the operations and returning the results. It is also responsible for all the specifics
of execution, such as connection management, threading, error handling, transactions, etc.

The way it usually works is that you only call the interpreter at the **edge** of your application - the `main` method;
a webservice method; a testcase. In this way, the bulk of your program only works with `DB` descriptions, and is referentially transparent.
Side effects are only performed in specific places, and in a controlled manner.

These are all the concepts you need to know to start working with `sane-dbc`. Let's now jump into details.

## Usage

### Basic usage examples

One of the things `sane-dbc` does is provide ready-to-use `DB` implementations for common tasks such as Select, Insert / Update,
batch Insert / Update, Aggregate (count, etc), and so forth.

Let's have a look at some of those in an example:
```java
package com.novarto.sanedbc.examples;

import com.novarto.sanedbc.core.interpreter.SyncDbInterpreter;
import com.novarto.sanedbc.core.ops.*;
import fj.Unit;
import fj.control.db.DB;
import fj.data.List;
import fj.data.Option;
import org.junit.Test;

import java.sql.DriverManager;

import static com.novarto.sanedbc.core.ops.DbOps.unique;
import static fj.data.List.nil;
import static java.util.Arrays.asList;
import static org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.is;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertThat;

public class BasicUsage
{

    /*
     * In a real-world application, DB-related operations are usually encapsulated in a separate module, so that's what we'll do here.
     * It's kind of like a DAO (Data Access Object) since it provides operations over a table, or a set of logically related tables.
     *
     * It's different from a DAO in that it does not access the database itself; rather it returns descriptions of how it should
     * be accessed - as already explained.
     *

        {
            //this specific table has auto-generated ID

            );
        }

    }
}
```

There's a couple more [built in operations](sane-dbc-core/src/main/java/com/novarto/sanedbc/core/ops) you can use, possibly
with more coming in the future. Consult the javadoc of the individual operations for more details.

Hopefully we have demonstrated scrapping the JDBC boilerplate into reusable operations makes Java SQL programming reasonable.
You can further apply this principle to your program by implementing your own `DB` instances.

A good property of the `DB` abstraction is that it is practically zero-cost. There is no SQL generation, automatic object mapping 
or anything of that sort going on. The total runtime overhead of using sane-dbc is the creation of a constant number of objects
(usually a couple) per DB operation. This gets amortized by the network call, and even by the creation of your DB's result object.

Another very useful property of the approach is that you are in full control of database interaction. Creating the SQL; supplying the
input; choosing the exact result type - these are all done by the library user.


### Composition

The `DB` abstraction enables us to compose `DB` instances with existing functions, and `DB` instances with other `DB` instances,
to obtain composite `DB`'s as a result.

#### `map`

The `DB` class defines the following operation:

```java
public final <B> DB<B> map(final F<A, B> f)
```
So map takes a `DB<A>`, a function `f: A -> B` and returns a `DB<B>`. That happens if the original DB<A> is successful.
If not, the `DB<B>` will just contain the original error. By contain, we mean it will throw it upon `run()`.

Let's see `map()` in action by implementing a simple login service (complete source [here](sane-dbc-examples/src/test/java/com/novarto/sanedbc/examples/MapExample1.java)):

```java
public static class UserDB
    {


        public static DB<Boolean> login(String email, String pass)
        {
            //we map an operation DB<Option<User>> with a function which takes an Option<User> and returns a boolean,
            //resulting in a DB<Boolean>
            return selectUser(email).map(userOpt -> {
                if (userOpt.isNone())
                {
                    //invalid email
                    return false;
                }

                User user = userOpt.some();
                //check pass hash matches
                return loginOk(user, pass);
            });
        }

        private static boolean loginOk(User user, String password)
        {
            return hash(password).equals(user.hash);
        }
        
        private static String hash(String password); // impl omitted

    }
```

```java
        dbi.submit(UserDB.insertUser("me@that.com", "abcd"));

        boolean success = dbi.submit(UserDB.login("me@that.com", "abcd"));
        assertThat(success, is(true));

        success = dbi.submit(UserDB.login("me@that.com", "wrong"));
        assertThat(success, is(false));

        success = dbi.submit(UserDB.login("larry@this.com", "abcd"));
        assertThat(success, is(false));
```

You can imagine many other examples. One might select a list of employees and group them by department, using
`java.util.stream.Collectors.groupingBy`. Or one might select a product catalog stored flat in a database, and turn it into
a `fj.data.Tree`. The important thing is, if you need to (and one always needs to) work with the data from your `DB`, you don't
run it - you just transform the original `DB` description using `map`. This way you delay performing side effects until the edge
of your app, where you interpret the `DB`.


#### `bind` (also known as `flatMap`)

What if we wanted to execute an operation, and upon its success, take the result and execute another operation based on that?

`bind` comes to the rescue:

```java
public final <B> DB<B> bind(final F<A, DB<B>> f);
```

So bind takes a `DB<A>` and a function which, given an A, produces a `DB<B>`. The final result is a `DB<B>`.
(If we had used `map` in this scenario, we would end up with a `DB<DB<B>>`, which is not convenient.)

For example, we might want to log a user in, and if successful, return their sales orders. If not, we return an error message.
(the full code is available [here](sane-dbc-examples/src/test/java/com/novarto/sanedbc/examples/BindExample.java))

```java
        //the operation authenticates the user, and reads their orders
        //it returns either an error message (string), in case the login fails; or the list of orders
        public static DB<Either<String, List<Order>>> authenticateAndGetOrders(String email, String pass)
        {
            // with bind (a.k.a. flatMap), we take the result of one operation, and use it to return another operation
            return UserDB.login(email, pass).bind(success -> {

                if(!success)
                {
                    Either<String, List<Order>> errorMessage = Either.left("auth failure");
                    // the DB.unit operation returns an immediate result with the passed value, without touching the connection
                    return DB.unit(errorMessage);
                }

                return selectOrdersByEmail(email).map(orders -> Either.right(orders));
            });
        }

        public static DB<List<Order>> selectOrdersByEmail(String userEmail)
        {
            return new SelectOp.FjList<>(
                    "SELECT ORDER_ID, USER_EMAIL, TEXT FROM ORDERS WHERE USER_EMAIL=?",
                    ps -> ps.setString(1, userEmail),
                    rs -> new Order(rs.getInt(1), rs.getString(2), rs.getString(3))
            );
        }
```

```java
        dbi.submit(UserDB.insertUser("john@doe.com", "abcd"));
        dbi.submit(UserDB.insertUser("foo@bar.com", "abcd"));

        dbi.submit(
                OrderDb.insertOrders(
                        arrayList(new CreateOrder("john@doe.com", "Hi there"),
                                new CreateOrder("foo@bar.com", "Bye there")
                        ))
        );

        Either<String, List<Order>> result = dbi.submit(OrderDb.authenticateAndGetOrders("john@doe.com", "abcd"));
        assertThat(result.isRight(), is(true));

        List<Order> orders = result.right().value();
        assertThat(orders.isSingle(), is(true));

        Order johnOrder = orders.head();
        assertThat(johnOrder.text, is("Hi there"));

        Either<String, List<Order>> shouldFail = dbi.submit(OrderDb.authenticateAndGetOrders("haxx0r", "abcd"));
        assertThat(shouldFail, is(Either.left("auth failure")));
```

With `bind` and `map` in our arsenal, we can compose and reuse existing `DB` operations,
as well as existing business logic functions (pure functions working on data and returning data, without being bothered with database specifics),
to arrive at composite operations that implement new use cases.

Because we only work with descriptions of DB interaction, and we only ever interpret those at the edge of our app,
there is no need to propagate `Connection` objects or `throws SqlException` clauses throughout the whole call stack,
as often happens when working with plain JDBC.

#### `fold` (also known as `reduce`)

Folding is the process of taking an iterable of things, and collapsing them to a single result.
Some examples of folds are:
- `java.util.stream.Stream.reduce()`
- `fj.data.List.foldLeft()`
- `fj.data.List.foldRight()`

One obvious way to fold a `ResultSet` into a single thing is to first get a `DB<Iterable<A>>` (for example, via a `SelectOp`)
and then do:
```java
db.map(iterable -> iterable.reduce(...));
``` 

This approach is fine in general; but it could be suboptimal if the `ResultSet` is very large, since we are constructing
an intermediate `Iterable` that we later discard.

We can do better: we can do the reduction directly while iterating the `ResultSet`, without using an intermediate collection:
(full source [here](sane-dbc-examples/src/test/java/com/novarto/sanedbc/examples/FoldExample.java))
```java
// we will select employees and group them by department
// the result type is immutable map from integer (department id) to a immutable list of employees from that department
FoldLeftSelectOp<HashArrayMappedTrie<Integer, List<Employee>>> selectGroupedByDepartment =
new FoldLeftSelectOp<>(
    "SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES",
    NO_BINDER,
    (soFar, rs) -> {
        // the current row of the resultset, which we will append to the result so far
        Employee employee = new Employee(rs.getInt(1), rs.getString(2), rs.getInt(3));

        // the employees collected so far for this department
        // if this is the first employee of this department, fromThisDepartment will be none()
        Option<List<Employee>> fromThisDepartment = soFar.find(employee.departmentId);

        return fromThisDepartment
            //in case there are already employees collected for this department,
            //append this employee to the already collected (cons)
            //and update the map so far, associating departmentId with the appended list
            .map(employees -> soFar.set(employee.departmentId, employees.cons(employee)))
            //otherwise update the map so far, associating departmentId with a sized-one list
            //containing this employee
            .orSome(() -> soFar.set(employee.departmentId, List.single(employee)));
        },

        initial
    );
```

Perhaps that was a handful to grasp if you're not used to working with immutable collections. The point is, we are doing a 
reduction while directly iterating the `ResultSet`, with an empty initial value, without resorting to building an intermediate
collection from the `ResultSet`, such as `java.util.List` or `fj.data.List`.

The result of the DB operation will be just like a hashmap from integer to a linkedlist of integer, only difference being neither
the hashmap, nor the lists can be mutated.

In the advanced section of the tutorial we will discuss when and why it is good practice to return an immutable object from your `DB`.

#### `sequence`

Sometimes you end up with an iterable of `DB<A>`. It is convenient to treat that as a single DB<List<A>>, containing the
aggregated result. This is achieved via the `sequence` operator.

>> If you find yourself in need to use `sequence`, first investigate if you can change your SQL query so that it returns all
the results in a single `DB`, in one go. That will usually be more performant.

```java
import static com.novarto.sanedbc.core.ops.DbOps.sequence;
```

```java
//given an iterable of DB's
List<DB<String>> dbList = arrayList(
    DB.unit("foo"),
    DB.unit("bar"),
    DB.unit("baz")
);

//we can treat it as a DB<List>
DB<List<String>> db = sequence(dbList);

List<String> result = dbi.submit(db);

assertThat(result, is(arrayList("foo", "bar", "baz")));
```


### Interpreters

Since `DB` only **describes** database operations, a lot of aspects are left for interpretation-time. This includes

- JDBC connection management
- Transactional behaviour
- Error handling
- Forking execution in another thread

This is handy, since this way methods returning `DB<A>` are only concerned with selecting from / updating the database and
building / transforming / composing the result, and nothing else. It also means that the same `DB<A>` instance can be executed
with different interpreters, yielding a different behaviour.

Interpeters will generally support these two methods:

- `submit` will submit the operation for execution with `autoCommit=true`
- `transact` will submit the operation transactionally, i.e. with `autoCommit=false`, and the operation will be rolled back
upon error

Interpreters will require a piece of code at construction time, which is capable of returning JDBC connections. This is just like 
a `DataSource`, except you don't have to implement the `DataSource` interface.

#### `SyncDbInterpreter`

As we already know, the simplest interpreter is `SyncDbInterprer`. It blocks the caller thread, and tries to execute the operation.
Upon error it throws RuntimeException. Here it is in action, again:

```sql
"CREATE TABLE DUMMY (ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, X NVARCHAR(200)"
```

```java
// a datasource backed by a HikariCP connection pool
HikariDataSource hikariDS = Hikari.createHikari("jdbc:hsqldb:mem:test", "sa", "", new Properties());


SyncDbInterpreter sync = new SyncDbInterpreter(
    //transform a datasource to a Try0<Connection, SqlException>
    lift(hikariDS)
);

sync.submit(new EffectOp("INSERT INTO DUMMY VALUES(1,'a')"));
Long count = sync.submit(new AggregateOp("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM DUMMY"));
assertThat(count, is(1L));

try
{
    sync.transact(new EffectOp(
        "INSERT INTO DUMMY VALUES((2, 'b'), (1,'a'))"
    ));
    fail("expected constraint violation");
}
catch (RuntimeException e)
{
    assertThat(e.getCause(), is(instanceOf(SQLException.class)));
    count = sync.submit(new AggregateOp("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM DUMMY"));
    //transactional, no records were updated
    assertThat(count, is(1L));
}
```

Thus far we can see that
- We can supply interpreters with a data source; we can easily construct a production-suitable one, too;
- We can achieve transactional behaviour by calling `transact()` instead of `submit()` 

#### `ValidationDbInterpreter`
Next, we might want to take a more principled approach to error handling. A common technique is to embed the exception that `run`
can throw in the return type of our interpreter, thus treating errors as regular values, instead of relying on try / catch.

You can achieve this behaviour by utilising [ValidationDbInterpreter](sane-dbc-core/src/main/java/com/novarto/sanedbc/core/interpreter/ValidationDbInterpreter.java).
Its return type is `Validation<Exception, A>`. It is a box which either contains the failure - `java.lang.Exception`, or the
successful result `<A>`.

```java
//construct an interpreter that turns the result type to Validation<Exception, A>
// we can reuse the same data source across multiple interpreters
ValidationDbInterpreter vdb = new ValidationDbInterpreter(lift(hikariDS));

Validation<Exception, Long> successExpected = vdb.submit(new AggregateOp("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM DUMMY"));
assertThat(successExpected.isSuccess(), is(true));
assertThat(successExpected.success(), is(1L));

RuntimeException rte = new RuntimeException("failed I have");
Validation<Exception, Long> failExpected = vdb.submit(new DB<Long>()
{
    @Override public Long run(Connection c) throws SQLException
    {
        // all subclasses of java.lang.Exception and lifted to Validation, not just SqlException
        throw rte;
    }
});

assertThat(failExpected.isFail(), is(true));
assertThat(failExpected.fail(), is(rte));
```
#### `AsyncDbInterpreter`

The examples so far have the property of blocking the caller thread when we call `submit`/`transact`. For some use cases this might be 
unsuitable. For example, if we are in a HTTP worker thread, we don't want to hijack it while blocking on JDBC.

In such cases you can use an [AsyncDbInterpreter](sane-dbc-core/src/main/java/com/novarto/sanedbc/core/interpreter/AsyncDbInterpreter.java).
It returns a `CompletableFuture<A>` which will be completed exceptionally iff the underlying `DB` throws; otherwise it will be
completed successfully.

```java
ExecutorService ex = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();

// submits DB operations using the supplied executor, returns CompletableFuture<A>
AsyncDbInterpreter async = new AsyncDbInterpreter(lift(hikariDS), ex);

CompletableFuture<Long> countFuture = async.submit(new AggregateOp("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM DUMMY"));
//blocking call, don't do this in production
Long theCount = countFuture.get();
assertThat(theCount, is(1L));

CompletableFuture<Long> failedFuture = async.submit(new AggregateOp("BLA BLA BLA"));

//blocking call, don't do in production
TestUtil.waitFor(() -> failedFuture.isCompletedExceptionally(), 5, SECONDS);

Throwable failure = getFailure(failedFuture);

assertThat(failure.getCause(), instanceOf(SQLException.class));
```

## Advanced concepts

### Design guidelines

This chapter outlines best practices and design considerations when using `sane-dbc`.

#### Threading model
Since `DB` is only involved with describing operations, it never performs any forking itself. This means that in a composite

`DB` operation (*pipeline*), all operations composing it happen in the same thread, and in sequence, e.g.

```java
    someDbOp() // is eventually interpreted in a thread 'X'
        .map(function1) //happens in thread 'X'
        .bind(result -> anotherDbOp(result)) //lambda called in thread 'X', and anotherDbOp() interpreted in thread 'X'
        .map(otherFunction) //thread 'X' again
```

Therefore the way to execute DB operations in parallel, is to submit them using one of the asynchronous interpreters, e.g.
```java
    AsyncDbInterpreter ai = ...;
    CompletableFuture<A> aFuture = ai.submit(op1);
    CompletableFuture<B> bFuture = ai.transact(op2);
``` 

#### Effective immutability

One consequence of separating description and interpretation is that the result of a `DB` operation may be consumed on a different
thread than the one producing the `DB` result. Therefore the result type `A` of a `DB<A>` must be thread safe.  

A simple and performant way to ensure thread safety is to make all your `DB` return types **immutable**.
You may have noticed that's what we do in all the examples in this repo, and there is a good reason.
This way you are thread-safe
by virtue of immutability, and no synchronization / locking / CAS takes place. 

Furthermore, we strongly encourage you use
true immutable collection types, as opposed to `java.util.Collections.unmodifiableXXX` wrappers, so that you do not have to incur
the overhead of copying. Such collection types can be found in popular libraries such as `functionaljava`, `vavr`, `guava`, etc.

`sane-dbc` is already made to work well with `functionaljava`. If you need to integrate another collection framework, that's
fairly straightforward:

* All the operations in the library dealing with collections take an `Iterable<A>` and therefore do not assume mutability
* You can make a `SelectOp` return any collection type, by either supplying a custom `CanBuildFrom` instance, or subclassing
`AbstractSelectOp`, which does not even assume an iterable, but works with any type

A thing worth noting is that while the *final* return type of your (potentially) composite DB should be immutable,
there is nothing preventing you from utilizing mutable data types in the *intermediate* operations in the pipeline.
This is because of the guarantee that all operations in the pipeline happen in a single thread. This is showcased in
[this example](sane-dbc-examples/src/test/java/com/novarto/sanedbc/examples/EffectivelyImmutable.java).

#### Serializing immutable types

If you are writing REST services or something similar, chances are you will need to serialize your `DB` result to `JSON`.
For `functionaljava` collections, we recommend utilizing [jackson-module-fj](https://github.com/novarto-oss/jackson-module-fj).

Similar functionality exists for other immutable collection libraries.

To serialize / deserialize immutable beans/domain objects, one uses [jackson-modules-java8](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8).
If you are using `jackson-module-fj`, it registers `jackson-modules-java8` automatically for you,
and everything will work out of the box.


### Handling DDL

Creating table definitions, altering them, inserting predefined data (such as, say, the default system user in a 
`USERS` table), and migrating existing data to reflect table alterations, are a bit different from regular `DB` code:

- Each instance of such actions should happen at most once;
- They should usually happen at application startup time, or at the first time the database is accessed;
- Their failure often indicates a fatal problem, and the application should shut down forcefully instead of proceeding.

Due to these considerations, we recommend you keep such actions separate from the rest of your code, and that you utilize 
a library which knows how to handle database migrations. In terms of a library, we have found that
[flyway](https://github.com/flyway/flyway) does the job well. Here is an [example](TODO) which shows how to use `flyway` 
in your code.


### Implementing your own interpreter

Implementing your own interpreter is very straightforward. There is no specific interface to implement, but the user will 
usually expect these two methods:

- `submit`, which executes the `DB` non-transactionally
- `transact`, which executes the `DB` transactionally, i.e. `commit`s at the end of the pipeline and rolls back in case of
failure

If you need to implement your own interpreter, it is best to look at some existing ones:

- [the most straightforward one](sane-dbc-core/src/main/java/com/novarto/sanedbc/core/interpreter/SyncDbInterpreter.java)
- [example with CompletableFuture](sane-dbc-core/src/main/java/com/novarto/sanedbc/core/interpreter/AsyncDbInterpreter.java)
- [example with Guava](sane-dbc-guava/src/main/java/com/novarto/sanedbc/guava/GuavaDbInterpreter.java)

We recommend you reuse the [existing](sane-dbc-core/src/main/java/com/novarto/sanedbc/core/interpreter/InterpreterUtils.java) logic
around commit / rollback, as is done in the examples above.


#### Why is there no 'Interpreter' interface?

An interpreter interface cannot be expressed in Java in a typesafe way. Conceptually, an interpreter is parametric on two
things:

- The result type of the interpretation, say `Future`, `CompletableFuture`, `Validation`, etc, which itself is type-parametric
- The result type of the `DB<A>` being interpreted, namely `A`

Since the type of the interpretation is itself type-parametric, we need [higher-kinded types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kind_(type_theory))
to express it. Java does not have this feature, therefore the interface does not exist in the library.

If this were `Scala`, we would write something along the lines of
```scala
trait DbInterpreter[F[_]] {
    def submit[A](db: DB[A]) : F[A]
    def transact[A](db: DB[A]) : F[A]
  }
```

That is, for a fixed thing `F` which takes a type parameter, and a `DB<A>` being interpreted, return an `F<A>`.
